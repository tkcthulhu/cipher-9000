# Cipher-9000

My first more in depth project with C#, this one was really fun! Using arrays, methods, loops and conditionals, this program will as ask if you want to encrypt or decrypt a message, ask for a cipher key, and then retrun the altered message in the console. Definetly the most entertaining project I've done in C# yet! Thanks for checking it out!
